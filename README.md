# Mr.SmartUseMe


**Overview**
MR.SmartUSEME is an AI-powered smart waste segregation system that uses a camera-mounted smart bin and a YOLO-based deep learning model to classify trash in real time.
The system detects different types of waste (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, organic, etc.) and determines the appropriate disposal category automatically.
This project aims to improve recycling efficiency, reduce human intervention, and support sustainable waste management in smart cities.

**Problem statement**
Manual waste segregation is:
Time-consuming
Prone to human error
Inefficient in large-scale environments

Improper waste disposal leads to:
Recycling contamination
Environmental pollution
Increased landfill waste
